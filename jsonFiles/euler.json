Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.\nUnfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.\nFor example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:\n\nIf the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.\nTo resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.\nLet F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors. For example, F(3) = 6, F(8) = 16276736, and F(100) mod 135707531 = 84326147.\nFind F(12344321) mod 135707531.\n","title":"Hilbert's Blackout"},"402":{"date":" Saturday, 17th November 2012, 07:00 pm","question":"It can be shown that the polynomial n4 + 4n3 + 2n2 + 5n is a multiple of 6 for every integer n.

After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either g < t, g = t, or g > t. Then the process can repeat as necessary.\nNormally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound L and upper bound H (initialized to L = 1 and H = n), let g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋ where ⌊⋅⌋ is the integer floor function. If g = t, the process ends. Otherwise, if g < t, set L = g+1, but if g > t instead, set H = g−1. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once t is found. Even if t can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.\nYour friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋, simply let g be a random integer between L and H, inclusive.

Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal. This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.

For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder.

A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by step.\nWhen a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result. For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: \"137\" → \"11\" → \"2\" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.\nEvery digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Number \"1\" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number \"4\" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number \"8\" lights them all.\nThe clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off. To turn on a \"2\" will cost 5 transitions, while a \"7\" will cost only 4 transitions.\nSam and Max built two different clocks.\nSam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"137\", then the panel is turned off, then the next number (\"11\") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (\"2\") is turned on and, after some time, off. For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:\n\"137\" : (2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions (\"137\" on/off). \"11\" : (2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions (\"11\" on/off). \"2\" : (5) × 2 = 10 transitions (\"2\" on/off).\nMax's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number. For number 137, Max's clock requires:\n\"137\" : 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\"137\" on) 7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number \"11\"). \"11\" : 0 transitions (number \"11\" is already turned on correctly) 3 transitions (to turn off the first \"1\" and the bottom part of the second \"1\"; the top part is common with number \"2\"). \"2\" : 4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a \"2\") 5 transitions (to turn off number \"2\").\nOf course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one. The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B = 2×107.

The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size. Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited. Each one can only process up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle. The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25), and whether to weld the long or short edge.\nFor example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw unit square plates to make a 11×1 strip.

He always demands that the finished product should have an exact area, and that the long side must not be more than 10% larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then he demands that all variants are produced. For example, if he were to ask for metal sheet of area 889200, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: 900×988, 912×975 and 936×950.

Each number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:\n\"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\", or \"Yes, that's it!\", or \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\".\nGiven the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.\nIf n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number \"2\". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).\nIf n=8, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy: Our first question would be \"4\" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions. Let our second question be \"6\". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8. Thus, our third question will be \"7\" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.\nWe can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking \"5\" as our first question. If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be \"7\", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=12). If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be \"3\" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be \"1\", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9. Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better than what we achieved previously with the \"binary search\" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy. So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.\nLet C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as described above.

After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.\nShe claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.\n\nMany millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.\nKatharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.\n(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits (ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining\nThe records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.\nKatharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].\nIn order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.

Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.\nAfter traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka.

The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.\nOn a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.\nThe stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive.

Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.\nNow consider a game of Super Ramvok:\nIn Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank.\nLet S(d, c) be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die to start (with all sides visible), and cost constant c. For example, S(6, 1) = 208.3.\nLet F(n) = ∑4≤d≤n ∑0≤c≤n S(d, c).\nCalculate F(20), rounded to the nearest integer.\n","title":"Super Ramvok"},"591":{"date":" Saturday, 18th February 2017, 01:00 pm","question":"Given a non-square integer $d$, any real $x$ can be approximated arbitrarily close by quadratic integers $a+b\\sqrt{d}$, where $a,b$ are integers.

An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.\nBecause of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead: The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. For each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,\nIf the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free. If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\nNegative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 = 0.9039207968. Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 × 5 = 1.480396016. Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 × 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\nWe may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases. If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected). We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.\nTo simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.\noptimal strategy\n4.155452\nUsing the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p to be present in any individual.

A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of A, B, and C in it, i.e., (a : b : c). For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2 : 3 : 5) contains 20% A, 30% B and 50% C.\nFor the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.\nFor example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3 : 0 : 2), (3 : 6 : 11) and (3 : 3 : 4). By mixing 10 units of the first, 20 units of the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio (6 : 5 : 9), since: (10·3/5 + 20·3/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·0/5 + 20·6/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·2/5 + 20·11/20 + 30·4/10) = (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)\nHowever, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio (3 : 2 : 1), since the amount of B is always less than the amount of C.\nLet n be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers (a, b, c) with 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n and gcd(a, b, c) = 1, we have a mixture with ratio (a : b : c). Let M(n) be the set of all such mixtures.\nFor example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios: {(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 1 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2), (0 : 2 : 1), (1 : 0 : 0), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 2), (1 : 1 : 0), (1 : 1 : 1), (1 : 1 : 2), (1 : 2 : 0), (1 : 2 : 1), (1 : 2 : 2), (2 : 0 : 1), (2 : 1 : 0), (2 : 1 : 1), (2 : 1 : 2), (2 : 2 : 1)}.\nLet E(n) be the number of subsets of M(n) which can produce the mixture with ratio (1 : 1 : 1), i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C.

Let S(k) represent chef #k's skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, S(k) is the probability that chef #k's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.\nThe game always begins with chef #1, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.\nDefine Wn(k) as the probability that chef #k wins in a competition with n chefs.

Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\nIn addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.\nCommunity Chest (2/16 cards): Advance to GO Go to JAIL Chance (10/16 cards): Advance to GO Go to JAIL Go to C1 Go to E3 Go to H2 Go to R1 Go to next R (railway company) Go to next R Go to next U (utility company) Go back 3 squares.\nThe heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in.

We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.\nUsing words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).\nWhat is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?\nNOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.\n","title":"Anagramic squares"},"99":{"date":" Friday, 1st July 2005, 06:00 pm","question":"Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.\nHowever, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.\nUsing base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.\nNOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.\n","title":"Largest exponential"}}
